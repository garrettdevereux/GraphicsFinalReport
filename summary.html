                <p>
                    In the end, I was able to implement the following features
                    from my proposal:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Depth of Field</li>
                        <li>Image Textures</li>
                        <li>Bump Mapping</li>
                        <li>Disney BSDF</li>
                        <li>Environment Maps</li>
                    </ul>

                    These will all work together to help build up my final image. I will
                    use a Depth of Field camera in the scene to create a realistic camera
                    effect. Image Textures and Bump Maps will be used on almost every mesh
                    to produce a realistic view of the objects. I will also be lighting the
                    scene with an Environment Map, as well as taking advantage of scenic background
                    produced. Finally, every BSDF in the scene is a Disney BSDF, taking advantage
                    of all the parameters implemented for an artistic and realistic scene.
                <p>

                    <br />
                <p>
                    As time runs short, I have not been able to fully implement the proposed
                    Smooth Plastic Layered BSDF. After some consideration, I believe that
                    is more beneficial to my learning and growth to focus on a few more simple
                    and new features that I can complete, rather than have a
                    incomplete advanced feature. That being said, I have additionally implemented
                    the following features.

                <h3 class="content-subhead">Additional Features</h3>

                <h4 class="content-subhead" style="margin: 0 0 0 0">Additional BSDF Params:</h4>

                <p>
                    Initially, I proposed implementing the 5 Disney BSDF params:
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>baseColor</code></li>
                        <li><code>metallic</code></li>
                        <li><code>specular</code></li>
                        <li><code>roughness</code></li>
                        <li><code>clearcoat</code></li>
                    </ul>

                    As I begin to dig into the
                    <a href="https://media.disneyanimation.com/uploads/production/publication_asset/48/asset/s2012_pbs_disney_brdf_notes_v3.pdf">
                        <i>Physically Based Shading at Disney</i>
                    </a>, I put a lot of time into fully understanding the formulas and process
                    which should be evident from the clean and well documented code. The formulas were described in terms of all the
                    parameters, so it was quite easy to follow the theory and simply include some addition parameters. These ended up being:
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>specularTint</code></li>
                        <li><code>clearcoatGloss</code></li>
                    </ul>
                    After completing this BSDF, I had access to a Clearcoat model and could simulate
                    a thin plastic layer over the surface, deterring me away from spending a lot of time implementing
                    another similar feature. In the end, I decided to explore some other new and simple features:
                </p>

                <h4 class="content-subhead" style="margin: 0 0 0 0">Modeling and Importing Meshes from Blender</h4>

                <p>
                    As my scene idea contained meshes with a lot of intricate pieces, I worked to use Blender to modify
                    my scene, and then utilized the
                    <a href="https://github.com/Phil26AT/BlenderNoriPlugin">
                        <i>BlenderNoriPlugin</i>
                    </a> to export my scene into Nori.
                    <br /> <br />
                    After a bit of online research, I found some meshes that I enjoyed such as this Royalty
                    Free mesh from
                    <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/rocky-ground-01-cdc6e6f2dccd4e03b638053dfc1d3efd">
                        <i>CGTrader</i>
                    </a>
                    and this
                    <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">
                        <i>CC Attribution</i>
                    </a> Licensed mesh from
                    <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/rocky-ground-01-cdc6e6f2dccd4e03b638053dfc1d3efd">
                        <i>Sketchfab</i>
                    </a>. I then worked in Blender to separate the meshes, perform some edits, cutting, resizing,
                    and smoothing, and spent a lot of time getting the BSDFs just right with image textures,
                    Disney BSDF params, and bump maps.

                    <span class="center">
                        <a href="images/blender.png"><img src="images/blender.png" width="600" alt="blender"></a>
                    </span>

                    This then produced a massive .xml file that I compile and render with Nori. However, there was
                    still some issues, such as the Textures being imported under the wrong file path and
                    no bump maps in the scene, leading to a lot of time spent tweaking the scene. Finally, this produced
                    a result that took a long time to render, but none the less an actual image containing all of my features (see Building
                    up the Final Result below).
                </p>

                <h4 class="content-subhead" style="margin: 0 0 0 0">Intel Open Image Denoise Integration:</h4>
                <p>
                    Finally, as I begin to render my images it became clear that there was a lot of noise
                    produced for how much time it took to render. That being said, to produce a good a clear image
                    I downloaded <a href="https://www.openimagedenoise.org/">
                        <i>Intel's Open Image Denoise</i>
                    </a> and changed my camera model to use a box reconstruction filter
                    rather than the gaussian. Then, I can simply feed my images into the denoiser to get much cleaner results.
